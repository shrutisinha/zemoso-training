Using TextFile and a Map<Character,Integer>, create a program that takes the file name as a 
command line argument and counts the occurrence of all the different characters. Save the results 
in a text file.

CharCounter class is the Main class.
TextFile.txt is the file from which it reads.
CharacterFreq.txt is the file to which the program writes.
