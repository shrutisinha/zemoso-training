/**<h3>Day 4 Java Assignment : Exception Handling </h3>
* Create three new types of exceptions. Write a class with a method that throws all three.
* In main( ), call the method but only use a single catch clause that will catch all three
* types of exceptions. Add a finally clause and verify that your finally clause is executed,
* even if a NullPointerException is thrown.
